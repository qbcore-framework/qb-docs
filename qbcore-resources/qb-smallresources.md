### Blacklist ped and vehicle models

```lua

    [`SHAMAL`] = true,
    [`LUXOR`] = true,
    [`LUXOR2`] = true,

```

## **Consumables** <a href="#blob-path" id="blob-path"></a>

{% hint style="warning" %}
When adding new consumables you need to go into the server/consumables.lua and make that item useable with the `QBCore.Functions.CreateUseableItem` function more info on how to do that in [server-function-reference.md](../qb-core/server-function-reference.md "mention")

You can also increase the thirst or hunger with \["itemname"] = math.random(-20, -10) or a single number, the only important thing is that the lower number is first
{% endhint %}

```lua
ConsumeablesEat = { -- how much hunger is relieved on use
    ["sandwich"] = math.random(35, 54), 
    ["tosti"] = math.random(40, 50),
    ["twerks_candy"] = math.random(35, 54),
    ["snikkel_candy"] = math.random(40, 50),
}

ConsumeablesDrink = { -- how much thirst is relieved on use
    ["water_bottle"] = math.random(35, 54),
    ["kurkakola"] = math.random(35, 54),
    ["coffee"] = math.random(40, 50),
}

ConsumeablesAlcohol = { -- how much thirst is relieved on use
    ["whiskey"] = math.random(20, 30),
    ["beer"] = math.random(30, 40),
    ["vodka"] = math.random(20, 40),
}
```

## Timed Jobs / Cron

{% hint style="info" %}
Timed jobs are used to execute code at a certain time every day. For example executing function x every monday when the clock is 08:20 AM etc.
{% endhint %}

### Usage (Server Exports):

*   CreateTimedJob(hour: number, min: number, callback: function)

    > Used for registering the actual timed job. Returns the index of the timed job which can be used to force run or stop the timed job.\
    > **Example:**
    >
    > ```lua
    > -- `idx` becomes the index of the timed job.
    > local idx = exports["qb-smallresources"]:CreateTimedJob(8, 20, function(day, hour, min)
    >    if day == 1 then -- check if its monday
    >        print("Its currently 08:20 AM on a monday")
    >    end
    > end)
    > ```
*   ForceRunTimedJob(idx: number)

    > Used to force run a timed job, even if the time isnt correct. Does not bypass local checks in the actual callback though.\
    > **Example:**
    >
    > ```lua
    > exports["qb-smallresources"]:ForceRunTimedJob(2)
    > ```
*   StopTimedJob(idx: number)

    > Stops the timed job forever (unless registered again).\
    > **Example:**
    >
    > ```lua
    > exports["qb-smallresources"]:StopTimedJob(3)
    > ```
